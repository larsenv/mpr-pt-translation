-# wszst settings:
-# ---------------
-#
-# This is the settings file for wszst (tool of "Wiimms SZS Tools"). It
-# was created by the EXTRACT command and is needed by the CREATE command
-# to rebuild the original source archive with or without modifications.
-# You can edit it, if you know what you do.
-#
-###############################################################################
-
-# The first part contains some general settings:
-
-# The internal archive format (U8, WU8, BRRES, BREFF or BREFT):
-archive-format = U8
-
-# The file format (YAZ0, YAZ1 or BZ for a compressed archive, other ignored):
-file-format = U8
-
-# An archive format related version number (-1: unknown or not relevant)
-version = -1
-
-# For U8+WU8 archives: Is there a special '.' base directory:
-have-pt-dir = 0
-
-# The minimum and maximum file data positions:
-min-data-offset = 0x0
-max-data-offset = 0xbc60
-
-# The calculated alignment of all files:
-data-align = 0x20
-
-###############################################################################
-#
-# Some general rules for the next sections:
-#   All paths are relative to the current base directory (directory that
-#   contains the file wszst-setup.txt). Prefix at least paths that starts
-#   not with a letter, digit, point, star or underscore with "./".
-#
-#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-[include-pattern]
-
-# All files and directories start with a . are hidden (unix like) and excluded
-# automatically. But filenames in one of the include sections are included
-# independent of this point. Also the include sections takes precedence over
-# the exclude sections.
-
-# This section expects file patterns with wildcards.
-
-#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

-
-# This second include section accpepts only complete file names and none of

-
-[exclude-pattern]
-
-# Files and directories in this section are ignored by the CREATE command.
-# The include sections takes precedence over the exclude sections.
-
-# This section expects file patterns with wildcards.
-# Here we exclude all original, backup and temp files:
-
-*.orig
-*.bak
-*.tmp
-*.temp
-
-# Exclude all *.d directories. To enable it, remove "# " at the beginning.
-# *.d
-
-# Exclude all PNG files. The intention is to allow the creation of new PNG
-# images and mipmap files without any need to edit this setup file. All
-# extracted PNG files are automatically listed in the [exclude] section.
-# So the exclusion of all PNG is not really needed, but may help. The second
-# (disabled) line is an alternative to exclude all mipmap PNG files.
-
-*.png
-# *.mm#.png

-[encode]
-
-# Encode (and overwrite without notice) the listed files before adding them
-# to the new archive. The source is searched under the same filename with the
-# correct source extension added or, if this failed, a replaced extension.
-#   Example: For "message.bmg" search files "message.bmg.txt" or "message.txt"
-# The source file itself is set on the exclude list and will not stored into
-# the new archive.
-#
-# The syntax of this file section is a little bit different as the other file
-# sections. Each line begins with a comma separated list of keywords followed
-# by an equal sign.
-#   Syntax:  COMMA_SEPARATED_FORMAT_LIST = relative_filename
-#   Example: BREFT,IA8,3 = ./files/rk_steam
-# The first keyword is the file format. The following keywords describe sub
-# formats. An additonal integer is a file type specific information:
-#  -> For image files it is the number of images (main image + mipmaps).
-#     A value of 0 means: Use the tools default (see option --n-mipmaps).
-#
-# A file is only encoded if the destination does not exist or if the source
-# is younger than the destination. Encoding can be controlled by options
-# --no-encode, --encode-img and --encode-all (short: --noenc --eimg --eall).

-[create]
-
-# Create (and overwrite without notice) the listed files before adding them to
-# the new archive. The source directory is searched under the same filename
-# with an appended ".d" or, if this fails, with an extension replaced by ".d".
-# If a source directory does not exist, the job is ignored silently.
-#   Example: For "my.brres" search directories "my.brres.d" or "my.d"
-# The source directory itself is set on the exclude list and will not stored
-# into the new archive. Creating can be controlled by the options:
-#   --no-recurse  : Do not create archives recursively.
-#   --no-encode   : Do not encode files before creating an archive.
-#   --encode-img  : Encode all image files (TEX,TPL,BREFT/sub), overrides --no-encode.
-#   --encode-all  : Encode all files and ignore timestamps.
-#   --pt-dir      : Set `point directory' mode.
-#   --u8          : Create an U8 archive.
-#   --brres       : Create an BRRES archive.
-#   --breff       : Create an BREFF archive.
-#   --breft       : Create an BREFT archive.

-[order]
-
-# This list contains all extracted files in the order of the original archive.
-# If creating archives (but not U8) this list will be used to sort the found
-# files. For archives with directory support (all but not PACK) it is very
-# important, that the directories are listed before the files that resides in
-# the directories.
-#
-# The value before the equal sign is the file offset in the original archive
-# and is ignored for sorting.
