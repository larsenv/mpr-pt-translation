Professor Red

PokéMorning!
Did you happen to see me on Pokémon Sunday?
I'm Professor Red!

I brought my METAGROSS, Homerun!

Oh, that's Machop!
You brought it for me, right?
Thank you.

So, let's trade.

I have to return to the PokéSun Company soon…
Let's meet again on "Pokémon Sunday"!
Poké we.. GO!

P.S.
Thank you for trading for METAGROSS.
My Homerun is really strong~!
Please take good care of it!

Well~, actually, I heard an amazing rumor that if you 
gather 8 Fighting Type Pokémon in the new ranch,
they'll have a Tournament!

I wonder, would you trade your MACHOP for my Homerun?

I'm going to watch the Pokémon on the ranch for a while.
