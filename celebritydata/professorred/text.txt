Professor Red

PokeMorning!
Did you happen to see (me/my performance) on Pokemon Sunday?
I'm Professor Red!

I brought my Metagross, Homerun!

Oh, that's Machop!
You brought it for me, (didn't you/right)?
Thank you (very much).

So, let's trade.

I have to (return/go back) to PokeSun Company soon……
Let's meet again on "Pokemon Sunday"!
Poke-We-Go!

P.S.
Thank you for trading for Metagross.
My Homerun is (really/very) (strong/fierce/tough/powerful)~!
Please take good care of (it/them/him)!

Well~, actually, I heard (a great/an amazing) rumor that if you 
(get/gather/put) 8 Fighting Type Pokemon in the new ranch,
they'll have a tournament!

I'm really (interested in/curious about) this, would you trade your Machop for my Homerun?

I'm going to (watch/observe) the Pokemon on the ranch for a while.
